cryptmount was written by RW Penney (England, UK)

The author gratefully recognizes the assistance of being able to refer
to the source-code for the following packages:
    cryptsetup-1.0.6 et seq.
    openssl-0.9.8 (specifically apps/enc.c, by Eric Young)
    devicemapper-1.01.05 (by Sistina UK)
    utillinux-2.12q (specifically mount/lomount.c)
Although cryptmount contains no code taken directly from any of these
or other packages, certain similarities of structure cannot be avoided
in some areas.
